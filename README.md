# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, where they take turns marking cells with either “X” or “O.” The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
How to Play
Both players choose either “X” or “O” to mark their cells.
The game board consists of a 3x3 grid with numbers assigned to each cell (from 1 to 9).
The player who chooses “X” begins the game by entering the cell number where they want to place their symbol.
Players take turns alternately until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
Winning criteria: If any player fills an entire row, column, or diagonal with their symbol, they win.
